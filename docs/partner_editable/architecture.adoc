Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** An optional Remote Desktop Gateway in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An optional Auto Scaling group of dedicated host instances.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* An AWS License Manager license configuration with an associated Microsoft Windows AMI.
* An AWS License Manager Host Resource Group associated with the Auto Scaling group in the private subnets.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

== EC2 Dedicated Infrastructure ==

Understanding the cost components while running Microsoft Workload on Amazon EC2 platform is critical.

When you run workload such Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon EC2 Instance, you pay for three components.

. EC2 resource i.e hourly charge for running instance type and instance size such as r5.4xlarge.
. Windows Server License
. SQL Server License

=== License Manager ===

AWS License Manager makes it easier to manage your software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM, across AWS and on-premises environments. 
This gives you better control and visibility of your licenses, allowing you to limit licensing overages and reduce the risk of non-compliance and misreporting.


=== Host Resource Group ===
A host resource group is a collection of Dedicated Hosts that you can manage as a single entity. As you launch instances, License Manager allocates the hosts and launches instances
 on them based on the settings that you configured. You can add existing Dedicated Hosts to a host resource group and take advantage of automated host management through License Manager.

You can use host resource groups to separate hosts by purpose, for example, development test hosts versus production, organizational unit, or license constraint. After you add a Dedicated 
Host to a host resource group, you cannot launch instances directly on the Dedicated Host, you must launch them using the host resource group.

. 

=== BYOL AMI ===
There are many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to choose from when launching your instances, and they support a variety of operating system platforms and features. 
To understand how the AMI you choose when launching your instance affects the bottom line on your AWS bill, you can research the associated operating system platform and billing information

BYOL AMI are sourced from customer environment either using migration tool such as CloudEndure or VMImport/Export. 
BYOL AMI carry billing code RunInstances:0800

== Advantages ==

. Benefit from the efficiencies of the AWS Cloud while utilizing existing investments in on-premises
software
. Extend the lifecycle of prior software versions
. Import your existing Windows images to the AWS Cloud
. Easily track licenses using AWS License Manager
. Enforce licensing rules,stay compliant and control overages
. Centrally report usage and discover installed software

== Use cases ==

==== BYOL Windows Only for web application ====

AWS offer wide range of compute, storage and networking to meet the need of customer application and database system. 
For this reason, selecting appropriate instance type and grouping them into Host resource group allows us to create a pool of dedicated host of similar Instance family.
If you choose to run web application , you can allow C5 instances as a supported family within HRG

==== BYOL Windows & SQL Enterprise ====


==== Windows License Included & BYOL SQL Enterprise ====
