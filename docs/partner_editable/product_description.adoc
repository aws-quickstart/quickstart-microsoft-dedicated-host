AWS provides a comprehensive set of services and tools for deploying Microsoft Windows-based workloads on its highly reliable and secure cloud infrastructure. {partner-product-name} uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over HTTPS to establish a secure, encrypted connection between remote users on the internet and Windows-based EC2 instances, without needing to configure a virtual private network (VPN) connection. This helps reduce the attack surface on your Windows-based instances while providing a remote administration solution for administrators.

This Quick Start automatically deploys and configures an {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure in the AWS Cloud from scratch, so you can securely administer your Windows-based, Amazon EC2 fleet using RDP over HTTPS. You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy a fully configured {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure in a new or existing VPC in your AWS account. You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.

We’ve also published a set of https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Quick Starts] that provide solutions for deploying common Microsoft workloads, such as Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange, and Microsoft SQL Server, on AWS. Those Quick Starts include the {partner-product-short-name} deployment and architecture described in this guide. You can use them to deploy {partner-product-short-name} along with the additional Microsoft workload. For example, for an automated deployment that includes Active Directory Domain Services and RD gateways, see the https://fwd.aws/N6e7B[AWS Quick Start for Active Directory Domain Services].

Implementing the {partner-product-short-name} on the AWS Cloud is an advanced topic. We recommend reviewing the Microsoft documentation for Windows Server 2016 and the AWS documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html[Connecting to Your Windows Instance].

This guide focuses on infrastructure configuration topics that require careful consideration when you are planning and deploying an {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure on the AWS Cloud. It doesn’t cover general Windows Server installation and software configuration tasks. For general software configuration guidance and best practices, consult the Microsoft product documentation.
