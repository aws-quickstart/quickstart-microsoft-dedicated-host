{partner-product-short-name} allow you to use your existing per-socket or per-core Microsoft Windows licenses. When you bring your own licenses, you are responsible for managing them. This Quick Start automates setting up the https://console.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/home?region=us-east-1#[AWS License Manager] license configuration and associates it with a https://console.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/home?region=us-east-1#/resourceGroups[host resource group].
