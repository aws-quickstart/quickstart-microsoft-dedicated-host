The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type or opting to use the Amazon-provided License Included AMI for Windows Server, will affect the cost of deployment. See the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using for cost estimates.

The Quick Start is configured to accept two licensing options for Windows Server DataCenter edition. You can:

* Use your volume licensing software and mobilize the license. When using your own Window Server license, you need to import your own images into Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

* Use the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Windows Server with license costs included. When using AWS-provided Windows Server licensing, you don't need to import your own Windows Images.
