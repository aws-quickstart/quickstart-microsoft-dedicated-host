==== Prepare a Windows AMI

Microsoft Windows AMIs provided by AWS include AWS-provided licenses. Since the purpose of this Quick Start is to allow dedicated
host users to bring their own Windows licenses, you will need to create a Windows AMI. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html[the instructions for importing a VM image to your AWS account].
