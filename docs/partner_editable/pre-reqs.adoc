=== Prepare a Windows AMI

Microsoft Windows AMIs provided by AWS include AWS-provided licenses. Since the purpose of this Quick Start is to allow {partner-product-short-name} users to bring their own Windows licenses, you must create a Windows AMI. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html[Importing a VM as an image using VM Import/Export].

If you are looking to combine AWS-provided licenses for Windows Server and run eligible application software such Microsoft SQL Server or SharePoint, you can bypass the above step and use an AWS-provided, license-included Windows Server AMI.
