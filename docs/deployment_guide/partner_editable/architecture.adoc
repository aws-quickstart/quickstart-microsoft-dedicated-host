image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** An optional Remote Desktop Gateway in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An optional Auto Scaling group of Dedicated Host instances. The instances host your Microsoft-licensed products (such as Windows Server and SQL Server) and are combined into a single host resource group that you manage as a single entity. 
* AWS License Manager for tracking and managing licenses and their associated AMIs in a host resource group.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
